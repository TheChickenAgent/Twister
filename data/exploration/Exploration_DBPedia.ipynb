WILZ can be heard in the Northern thumb area, around their niche market, Saginaw/Bay City. It reaches farther south through the Flint and Lapeer county areas. With weaker radios, an adjustment of the antenna is needed, because of adjacent channel interference from Detroit's WOMC on 104.3. 104.5 FM began in the early 1990s as WUVE, an album oriented rock station that aired some programming from ABC/Satellite Music Network's \\\\\\\"Z Rock\\\\\\\" network (though not an official \\\\\\\"Z-Rock\\\\\\\" affiliate). The station became WMJA (\\\\\\\"Magic\\\\\\\") with a classic hits format in 1995, and then adopted its current calls and format in 1999 (possibly in tribute to former Detroit album-rock station WLLZ 98.7 FM, now Top-40 WDZH). WILZ's format was formerly simulcast on then-sister station WYLZ (100.9 FM) (now WLUN), licensed to Pinconning, Michigan.

The AZ series uses an aluminium engine block with cast iron cylinder liners and aluminium DOHC cylinder heads. The engine series features many advanced technologies including slant-squish combustion chambers,offset cylinder and crank centers, and the VVT-i continuously variable intake valve timing system. The aluminium engine measures 626 mm (25-in) long, 608 mm (24-in) wide, and 681 mm (27-in) tall. The cylinder block is an open-deck, midi-skirt die-cast aluminium type with cast-in iron liners and a die-cast aluminium lower crankcase and a stamped oil pan. The forged steel crankshaft is fully balanced with eight counterweights and supported by five main bearings. A helical gear pressed in No. 3 counterweight drives twin contra-rotating balance shafts in the shaft housing within the lower crankcase. The dual overhead camshafts are driven by a single-stage roller chain of 8.0 mm (0.3-in) pitch, enabling a narrow included valve angle of 27.5\\u00b0. The camshafts act on four valves per cylinder via bucket tappets. As in the recent Toyota engine practice, no clearance adjusting shim is employed. Valve diameters are 34.0 mm (1.3 in) for intake and 29.5 mm (1.2 in) for exhaust, with 8.0 mm (0.3-in) lift for both intake and exhaust. The four-vane VVT-i device is fitted on the intake camshaft, altering timing by 50\\u00b0. The valve cover is made of magnesium to save weight. Fuel is injected sequentially via an ultra-fine-atomization injector with twelve small injection holes, each 0.18 mm (0.01 in) in diameter. As in the smaller NZ engine, the new AZ adopts a plastic, built-up, and vibration-welded intake manifold integrating a large volume plenum chamber (3.5 L (214 in3) volume including a 1.3 L (79 in3) resonator). Exhaust manifolds are of tubular construction with integrated catalytic converters. The AZ is the replacement for the S engine.

During the engine's first decade of production, when overhead-valve engines were rare, it was usually known simply as the Ford V\\u20118, and the first car model in which it was installed, the Model 18, was (and still is) often called simply the \\\\\\\"Ford V\\u20118\\\\\\\", after its new engine. Although the V8 configuration was not new when the Ford V8 was introduced in 1932, the latter was a market first in the respect that it made an 8-cylinder affordable and a V engine affordable to the emerging mass market consumer for the first time. It was the first independently designed and built V8 engine produced by Ford for mass production, and it ranks as one of the company's most important developments. A fascination with ever-more-powerful engines was perhaps the most salient aspect of the American car and truck market for a half century, from 1923 until 1973. The Ford flathead V8 was perfectly in tune with the cultural moment of its introduction, leading the way into a future of which the Ford company was a principal architect. Thus it became a phenomenal success. The engine design, with various changes but no major ones, was installed in Ford passenger cars and trucks until 1953, making the engine's 21-year production run for the U.S. consumer market longer than the 19-year run of the Ford Model T engine for that market. The engine was on Ward's list of the 10 best engines of the 20th century. It was a staple of hot rodders in the 1950s, and it remains famous in the classic car hobbies even today, despite the huge variety of other popular V8s that followed.\", \"trunc_text\": \"The Ford flathead V8 (often called simply the Ford flathead, flathead Ford, or flatty when the context is implicit, such\", \"r\": 0, \"color\": \"none\"}, {\"x1\": 0.4026191642250452, \"x2\": -0.2719495933856467, \"text\": \"The Ford Pinto engine was the unofficial but generic nickname for a four-cylinder internal combustion engine built by Ford Europe.

Engines were built in the Dearborn Engine Plant for the North American market, and in Ford's then-new engine plant in Bridgend in Wales for the European market. The engine was originally conceived in 1974 and had a single overhead cam. Its valves were mounted at a compound angle in hemispherical combustion chambers, although some versions altered the combustion chamber shape to increase swirl. It also featured hydraulic valve lifters, a first for a European Ford engine. The engine was given different names throughout its production.

Despite its considerable shortcomings in terms of Noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) and its intolerance of poor or neglected servicing, the CVH was regarded as being a very easy engine to tune, with many of its key components being considerably over-engineered. It wasn't long before the engine started receiving attention from the aftermarket tuning industry, and the 1.6 L version quickly became a stalwart of the tuning scene in the 1980s and 1990s with some significant increases in power output (over 200 bhp (150 kW)) being extracted from the turbocharged variants. The naturally aspirated 1.6 L was a popular choice for the kit car industry, where it could be relatively easily and cheaply tweaked to around 130 bhp (97 kW).

This made it one of 10 states (plus the District of Columbia) to vote for Dukakis, while Bush won a convincing electoral victory nationwide. The farm crisis of the 1980s under the incumbent Republican administration made the Midwest one of the targets for the Dukakis campaign in 1988, which ultimately proved successful in the region with Democrats performing strongly in many farm states. Nowhere was this more evident than in Iowa, which was the second most Democratic state in the nation in 1988 in terms of both vote percentage and victory margin; it was one of just two states (along with Rhode Island) to vote Democratic by a double digit margin. This Democratic support was spread widely across the state, with Dukakis winning 75 of the state's 99 counties. Iowa was also the only state in the nation which Dukakis won by a larger margin than fellow Democrat Bill Clinton would win it by four years later in 1992; Dukakis won 13 counties in Iowa in 1988 which would vote for Bush in 1992. While Dukakis personally overperformed in Iowa due to the farm crisis, 1988 was also the beginning of a long-term re-alignment of the state toward the Democratic Party, as the historically-Republican state has been a Democratic-leaning state ever since; prior to this election, Iowa had voted Republican in the five preceding elections.

From Minden, the highway branched east to Haliburton Village and thereafter followed the present route of Highway 118 to Highway 28 in Paudash. Highway 121 was established in 1955, connecting to Highway 35 near Fenelon Falls and Minden.

It is reached by Autoroute 640 at exit 44. The runway is parallel to Autoroute 640. A radio equipped aircraft is required to fly in and out of Mascouche Airport. The mandatory frequency for the airport is 122.35 MHz. The Mascouche airport is the largest \\\\\\\"regional airport\\\\\\\" in the province of Quebec, in terms of air traffic. It is located close to the Le Gardeur regional hospital and could be used for medical evacuations in the future. The airport regroups 30 buildings, 15 related SMEs (including Cargair Inc., ALM Par Avion, and others) and sustains 75 full-time jobs. More than a hundred small planes are stationed there year-round. There has been talks of closing down (or to privatize) the airport during the last decade, for various reasons: the land lots are well-located and are zoned industrial, the city is unwilling to invest in the airport, and the airport couldn't get funds from the government to build a control tower and to expand the runway's length. Moreover, the poor condition of the airport (i.e. its runway and its buildings) would need considerable investments in a close future. To counter the closure of the airport, users have founded a group (Mascouche Airport Owners and Pilots Association MAOPA). With more than 125 members, this dynamic group fights hard to keep the airport open, organizing many activities to stimulate the interest of the population about the airport. Mascouche airport is home to several flying schools. Therefore, it is an important learning centre for new pilots. Indeed, the airport offers a great alternative to Montr\\u00e9al\\u2013Pierre-Elliot Trudeau International Airport (which charges important landing fees).

It is located on the square block bounded clockwise from the North by West Randolph Street, North State Street, West Washington Street and North Dearborn Street that is known as \\\\\\\"Block 37\\\\\\\", which was its designated number as one of the original 58 blocks of the city. The project broke ground on November 15, 2005. On July 31, 2006, the construction phase began. July 2008 marked the opening of the first of the three structures and the shopping center opened in November 2009. The Mills Corporation has also been contracted to develop an underground transit center beneath Block 37 that will be jointly funded by the City of Chicago, the Chicago Transit Authority and The Mills Corporation. The planned project includes a new subway station, track connections and a common downtown airport check-in facility for train service to both O'Hare and Midway airports. Since the purchase in April 2007 the project has stalled. The CTA has pulled out of the project and the current economic climate has stalled the project. Delays in completion have caused the project to lose major tenants. Both Block 37 and The Mills Corporation have histories of financial difficulties. Block 37 had been demolished in 1989 for a hotly contested redevelopment plan under the then new Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. The debates included the demolition of the Chicago Landmark McCarthy Building, which proceeded after the Illinois Supreme Court decided private preservation groups did not have standing to challenge the city's decision. Once the site was cleared, the initial redevelopment plan fell through, as did several subsequent plans, leaving the block vacant and undeveloped for nearly a generation. The Mills Corporation has itself been in financial difficulty in the past. This reputation and changing financial climate caused a delay in 2006 as contractors feared not getting paid. During the construction, cost overruns and delays have forced the city of Chicago and the Chicago Transit Authority to make up for a shortfall of over $100 million. In November 2009, the developer was declared in default and CB Richard Ellis was named receiver. By February 2012, the building remained only 26 percent occupied due to the undesirability of leasing space in bankruptcy proceedings. Construction of the apartment tower began in October 2014. The retail spaces remained only 52 percent leased at the time.\", \"trunc_text\": \"108 North State Street is a site currently under development as an urban center located in the Loop community area of do\", \"r\": 0, \"color\": \"none\"}, {\"x1\": 0.32930504659402543, \"x2\": -0.017127294937657855, \"text\": \"Argyle International Airport is a yet-to-be completed government project that has been under construction in St. Vincent and the Grenadines for seven and a half years.

The 1971 season was part of a 35-game winning streak that consisted of three consecutive seasons from 1969 through 1971. During the streak, Toledo won three consecutive MAC championships and three consecutive bowl games, led the nation in total defense all three years, and outscored opponents by a combined total of 1,152 to 344. It remains the second longest winning streak in modern Division I-A college football history behind Oklahoma's 47-game streak in the 1950s. The defense led the way for the 1971 team, allowing only 164.6 total yards per game, a figure which remains a school record. Quarterback Chuck Ealey, who had led Toledo to all three undefeated seasons, finished eighth in the 1971 Heisman Trophy voting with 168 points. Ealey was also selected as a first-team All-American by the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) and Football News. For the third consecutive year, Ealey was also named the MAC Back of the Year. For the second consecutive year, he received the Jim Nicholson Award as the player contributing the most to the team's success. Defensive tackle Mel Long was a consensus All-American, receiving first-team honors from the Associated Press, FWAA, Newspaper Enterprise Association, and United Press International. Long was the first consensus All-American in MAC history. Long was also named MAC Lineman of the Year for the second consecutive year. Five Toledo players received first-team All-MAC honors: Chuck Ealey, Mel Long, tailback Joe Schwartz, end Don Fair, tight end Al Baker, defensive end Bob Rose, linebacker John Niezgoda, and defensive backs Gary Hinkson and John Saunders.

Bands such as Venom, Celtic Frost, Slayer, and Kreator were important influences on the genre's creation. Possessed and Death, along with bands such as Obituary, Autopsy and Morbid Angel, are often considered pioneers of the genre.

In calling itself an \\\\\\\"entertaining\\\\\\\" journal, it is not strictly a journal of humor and unserious work.

Since 2003, The Green Bag has issued bobblehead dolls depicting Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, both present and past. In addition to the periodical, the Green Bag Press publishes other works of legal interest, including The Green Bag Almanac and Reader, an annual collection of the year's best legal writing, In Chambers Opinions by the Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, and The Journal of Law. In addition, every year the journal releases a list of outstanding legal writing.  From 2013 to 2015, the Green Bag's website and Twitter feed also included a weekly \\\\\\\"lunchtime law quiz\\\\\\\" feature. The Green Bag, second series was inspired by the original Green Bag, a legal magazine that was published between 1889 and 1914, and popular during the Progressive Era.

The games were developed by the German studio Bright Future GmbH and EA Sports. The game was called Total Club Manager (short: TCM) until the name changed to FIFA Manager with the FIFAM 06. It was announced FIFA Manager's last installment was FIFA Manager 14 and that there would be no further editions to the game. Before FIFAM and TCM, EA Sports released FIFA Soccer Manager (1997) and The FA Premier League Football Manager 99, 2000, 2001 and 2002, but while the first managed to attract some attention, the latter were released when the managing games market for non-Championship Manager titles was close to non-existent, and after two unsuccessful titles, it was dropped. However, by 2001, several employees of German software house Ascaron, who developed the highly popular Anstoss series in the past moved to EA, and the first game, Fussball Manager 2002, was released in Germany only, as a test for a potential series. It resembled Anstoss 3, although on a more serious note (in Anstoss, players could be abducted by aliens, train in Area 51 or use performance-enhancing drugs) and fewer financial options (managers developed by German teams often include deep financial options, such as stock and real estate markets). The game had positive reception, and a year later Total Club Manager 2003 was released, with Bobby Robson on the cover (for the second time, after FIFA Soccer Manager). One of the key features of Anstoss 3 was the ability to actually play the games after Anstoss Action was released. Although it could be played as a stand-alone game, it only reached the full potential when used with the manager game. This feature, only present on other games with limited geographical distribution, the Spanish PC F\\u00fatbol, was included for buyers of both TCM 2004 and FIFA 2004, which could use the Football Fusion function. Some fans managed to control games in TCM 2003 by hacking the configuration files, but data loss and corruption was frequent. Celtic manager Martin O'Neill appeared on the cover of TCM 2004. Criticized by a confusing interface, EA reworked it for TCM 2005, with a more sleek design. European Champion with former FC Porto and Chelsea manager Jos\\u00e9 Mourinho was selected for the main cover. While the TCM series has been released for Windows, Xbox and PlayStation 2, the FIFAM series is only available for Windows.

The station is the local affiliate of the syndicated programs The Bob and Tom Show.Former syndicated program Nights with Alice Cooper ended in the beginning of March, 2012. WILZ can be heard in the Northern thumb area, around their niche market, Saginaw/Bay City. It reaches farther south through the Flint and Lapeer county areas. With weaker radios, an adjustment of the antenna is needed, because of adjacent channel interference from Detroit's WOMC on 104.3. 104.5 FM began in the early 1990s as WUVE, an album oriented rock station that aired some programming from ABC/Satellite Music Network's \\\\\\\"Z Rock\\\\\\\" network (though not an official \\\\\\\"Z-Rock\\\\\\\" affiliate). The station became WMJA (\\\\\\\"Magic\\\\\\\") with a classic hits format in 1995, and then adopted its current calls and format in 1999 (possibly in tribute to former Detroit album-rock station WLLZ 98.7 FM, now Top-40 WDZH). WILZ's format was formerly simulcast on then-sister station WYLZ (100.9 FM) (now WLUN), licensed to Pinconning, Michigan. WYLZ has broadcast a variety of different formats since signing on in 1983. 104.5 and 100.9 together were known as \\\\\\\"Wheelz 104.5 and 101\\\\\\\" from 1999 to 2007. In June 2007, WYLZ was sold by Citadel Broadcasting (along with nine other stations) to The Last Bastion Station Trust, LLC, as part of ABC Radio's absorption into Citadel. Upon ending the simulcast, WYLZ switched to a satellite-fed country format (\\\\\\\"Mainstream Country\\\\\\\" from Dial Global) under the \\\\\\\"Thunder Country\\\\\\\" moniker. Despite the programming changes, WYLZ continued to air play-by-play of Great Lakes Loons baseball during the summer of 2007. In winter of 2008 the Great Lakes Loons finally took over ownership and changed the station to sports radio under new calls WLUN.

The aluminium engine measures 626 mm (25-in) long, 608 mm (24-in) wide, and 681 mm (27-in) tall. The cylinder block is an open-deck, midi-skirt die-cast aluminium type with cast-in iron liners and a die-cast aluminium lower crankcase and a stamped oil pan. The forged steel crankshaft is fully balanced with eight counterweights and supported by five main bearings. A helical gear pressed in No. 3 counterweight drives twin contra-rotating balance shafts in the shaft housing within the lower crankcase. The dual overhead camshafts are driven by a single-stage roller chain of 8.0 mm (0.3-in) pitch, enabling a narrow included valve angle of 27.5\\u00b0. The camshafts act on four valves per cylinder via bucket tappets. As in the recent Toyota engine practice, no clearance adjusting shim is employed. Valve diameters are 34.0 mm (1.3 in) for intake and 29.5 mm (1.2 in) for exhaust, with 8.0 mm (0.3-in) lift for both intake and exhaust. The four-vane VVT-i device is fitted on the intake camshaft, altering timing by 50\\u00b0. The valve cover is made of magnesium to save weight. Fuel is injected sequentially via an ultra-fine-atomization injector with twelve small injection holes, each 0.18 mm (0.01 in) in diameter. As in the smaller NZ engine, the new AZ adopts a plastic, built-up, and vibration-welded intake manifold integrating a large volume plenum chamber (3.5 L (214 in3) volume including a 1.3 L (79 in3) resonator).

It was the first independently designed and built V8 engine produced by Ford for mass production, and it ranks as one of the company's most important developments. A fascination with ever-more-powerful engines was perhaps the most salient aspect of the American car and truck market for a half century, from 1923 until 1973. The Ford flathead V8 was perfectly in tune with the cultural moment of its introduction, leading the way into a future of which the Ford company was a principal architect. Thus it became a phenomenal success. The engine design, with various changes but no major ones, was installed in Ford passenger cars and trucks until 1953, making the engine's 21-year production run for the U.S. consumer market longer than the 19-year run of the Ford Model T engine for that market. The engine was on Ward's list of the 10 best engines of the 20th century.

Engines were built in the Dearborn Engine Plant for the North American market, and in Ford's then-new engine plant in Bridgend in Wales for the European market. The engine was originally conceived in 1974 and had a single overhead cam. Its valves were mounted at a compound angle in hemispherical combustion chambers, although some versions altered the combustion chamber shape to increase swirl. It also featured hydraulic valve lifters, a first for a European Ford engine. The engine was given different names throughout its production.

This made it one of 10 states (plus the District of Columbia) to vote for Dukakis, while Bush won a convincing electoral victory nationwide. The farm crisis of the 1980s under the incumbent Republican administration made the Midwest one of the targets for the Dukakis campaign in 1988, which ultimately proved successful in the region with Democrats performing strongly in many farm states. Nowhere was this more evident than in Iowa, which was the second most Democratic state in the nation in 1988 in terms of both vote percentage and victory margin; it was one of just two states (along with Rhode Island) to vote Democratic by a double digit margin. This Democratic support was spread widely across the state, with Dukakis winning 75 of the state's 99 counties. Iowa was also the only state in the nation which Dukakis won by a larger margin than fellow Democrat Bill Clinton would win it by four years later in 1992; Dukakis won 13 counties in Iowa in 1988 which would vote for Bush in 1992. While Dukakis personally overperformed in Iowa due to the farm crisis, 1988 was also the beginning of a long-term re-alignment of the state toward the Democratic Party, as the historically-Republican state has been a Democratic-leaning state ever since; prior to this election, Iowa had voted Republican in the five preceding elections.

As part of the construction of the Hunter Expressway, the interchange of the Pacific Motorway and Newcastle Link Road has been upgraded with the addition of three new bridges next to the original single bridge, maintaining the previous grade separation conditions and directly connecting into the Hunter Expressway. In preparation of the increased demand on Newcastle Link Road from the construction of the Hunter Expressway, the intersections with Cameron Park Drive / Woodford Street and Lake Road / Thomas Street were upgraded from roundabouts to become traffic light controlled. The route was also signed with the A15 number in early 2014 to reflect the increased status of this route into Newcastle.\", \"trunc_text\": \"Newcastle Link Road is a limited-access road that links Newcastle, New South Wales to the Pacific Motorway and Sydney.

From Minden, the highway branched east to Haliburton Village and thereafter followed the present route of Highway 118 to Highway 28 in Paudash. Highway 121 was established in 1955, connecting to Highway 35 near Fenelon Falls and Minden.

It is reached by Autoroute 640 at exit 44. The runway is parallel to Autoroute 640. A radio equipped aircraft is required to fly in and out of Mascouche Airport. The mandatory frequency for the airport is 122.35 MHz. The Mascouche airport is the largest \\\\\\\"regional airport\\\\\\\" in the province of Quebec, in terms of air traffic. It is located close to the Le Gardeur regional hospital and could be used for medical evacuations in the future. The airport regroups 30 buildings, 15 related SMEs (including Cargair Inc., ALM Par Avion, and others) and sustains 75 full-time jobs. More than a hundred small planes are stationed there year-round. There has been talks of closing down (or to privatize) the airport during the last decade, for various reasons: the land lots are well-located and are zoned industrial, the city is unwilling to invest in the airport, and the airport couldn't get funds from the government to build a control tower and to expand the runway's length. Moreover, the poor condition of the airport (i.e. its runway and its buildings) would need considerable investments in a close future. To counter the closure of the airport, users have founded a group (Mascouche Airport Owners and Pilots Association MAOPA). With more than 125 members, this dynamic group fights hard to keep the airport open, organizing many activities to stimulate the interest of the population about the airport. Mascouche airport is home to several flying schools. Therefore, it is an important learning centre for new pilots.

July 2008 marked the opening of the first of the three structures and the shopping center opened in November 2009. The Mills Corporation has also been contracted to develop an underground transit center beneath Block 37 that will be jointly funded by the City of Chicago, the Chicago Transit Authority and The Mills Corporation. The planned project includes a new subway station, track connections and a common downtown airport check-in facility for train service to both O'Hare and Midway airports. Since the purchase in April 2007 the project has stalled. The CTA has pulled out of the project and the current economic climate has stalled the project. Delays in completion have caused the project to lose major tenants. Both Block 37 and The Mills Corporation have histories of financial difficulties. Block 37 had been demolished in 1989 for a hotly contested redevelopment plan under the then new Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. The debates included the demolition of the Chicago Landmark McCarthy Building, which proceeded after the Illinois Supreme Court decided private preservation groups did not have standing to challenge the city's decision. Once the site was cleared, the initial redevelopment plan fell through, as did several subsequent plans, leaving the block vacant and undeveloped for nearly a generation. The Mills Corporation has itself been in financial difficulty in the past. This reputation and changing financial climate caused a delay in 2006 as contractors feared not getting paid. During the construction, cost overruns and delays have forced the city of Chicago and the Chicago Transit Authority to make up for a shortfall of over $100 million. In November 2009, the developer was declared in default and CB Richard Ellis was named receiver. By February 2012, the building remained only 26 percent occupied due to the undesirability of leasing space in bankruptcy proceedings. Construction of the apartment tower began in October 2014. The retail spaces remained only 52 percent leased at the time.\", \"trunc_text\": \"108 North State Street is a site currently under development as an urban center located in the Loop community area of do\", \"r\": 0}, {\"x1\": 2.1324503421783447, \"x2\": 4.565775394439697, \"text\": \"Argyle International Airport is a yet-to-be completed government project that has been under construction in St. Vincent and the Grenadines for seven and a half years.

The season ended with a 28\\u20133 victory over Southern Conference champion Richmond in the 1970 Tangerine Bowl. The Rockets were ranked No. 14 in the final AP Poll and No. 13 in the final UPI Poll. The 1971 season was part of a 35-game winning streak that consisted of three consecutive seasons from 1969 through 1971. During the streak, Toledo won three consecutive MAC championships and three consecutive bowl games, led the nation in total defense all three years, and outscored opponents by a combined total of 1,152 to 344. It remains the second longest winning streak in modern Division I-A college football history behind Oklahoma's 47-game streak in the 1950s. The defense led the way for the 1971 team, allowing only 164.6 total yards per game, a figure which remains a school record. Quarterback Chuck Ealey, who had led Toledo to all three undefeated seasons, finished eighth in the 1971 Heisman Trophy voting with 168 points. Ealey was also selected as a first-team All-American by the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) and Football News. For the third consecutive year, Ealey was also named the MAC Back of the Year. For the second consecutive year, he received the Jim Nicholson Award as the player contributing the most to the team's success. Defensive tackle Mel Long was a consensus All-American, receiving first-team honors from the Associated Press, FWAA, Newspaper Enterprise Association, and United Press International. Long was the first consensus All-American in MAC history. Long was also named MAC Lineman of the Year for the second consecutive year. Five Toledo players received first-team All-MAC honors: Chuck Ealey, Mel Long, tailback Joe Schwartz, end Don Fair, tight end Al Baker, defensive end Bob Rose, linebacker John Niezgoda, and defensive backs Gary Hinkson and John Saunders. The team captains were Ealey, Long and Hinkson. The team's statistical leaders included Chuck Ealey with 1,821 passing yards, Joe Schwartz with 1,130 rushing yards and 120 points scored, Don Fair with 773 receiving yards, and John Niezgoda with 178 tackles. Jack Murphy had been an assistant coach at Toledo under Frank Lauterbur. After Lauterbur resigned in December 1970 to become head football coach at Iowa, Murphy was named as the new head coach.

Bands such as Venom, Celtic Frost, Slayer, and Kreator were important influences on the genre's creation. Possessed and Death, along with bands such as Obituary, Autopsy and Morbid Angel, are often considered pioneers of the genre. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, death metal gained more media attention as popular genre niche record labels like Combat, Earache, and Roadrunner, began to sign death metal bands at a rapid rate.

The games were developed by the German studio Bright Future GmbH and EA Sports. The game was called Total Club Manager (short: TCM) until the name changed to FIFA Manager with the FIFAM 06. It was announced FIFA Manager's last installment was FIFA Manager 14 and that there would be no further editions to the game. Before FIFAM and TCM, EA Sports released FIFA Soccer Manager (1997) and The FA Premier League Football Manager 99, 2000, 2001 and 2002, but while the first managed to attract some attention, the latter were released when the managing games market for non-Championship Manager titles was close to non-existent, and after two unsuccessful titles, it was dropped. However, by 2001, several employees of German software house Ascaron, who developed the highly popular Anstoss series in the past moved to EA, and the first game, Fussball Manager 2002, was released in Germany only, as a test for a potential series. It resembled Anstoss 3, although on a more serious note (in Anstoss, players could be abducted by aliens, train in Area 51 or use performance-enhancing drugs) and fewer financial options (managers developed by German teams often include deep financial options, such as stock and real estate markets). The game had positive reception, and a year later Total Club Manager 2003 was released, with Bobby Robson on the cover (for the second time, after FIFA Soccer Manager). One of the key features of Anstoss 3 was the ability to actually play the games after Anstoss Action was released. Although it could be played as a stand-alone game, it only reached the full potential when used with the manager game. This feature, only present on other games with limited geographical distribution, the Spanish PC F\\u00fatbol, was included for buyers of both TCM 2004 and FIFA 2004, which could use the Football Fusion function. Some fans managed to control games in TCM 2003 by hacking the configuration files, but data loss and corruption was frequent. Celtic manager Martin O'Neill appeared on the cover of TCM 2004. Criticized by a confusing interface, EA reworked it for TCM 2005, with a more sleek design. European Champion with former FC Porto and Chelsea manager Jos\\u00e9 Mourinho was selected for the main cover. While the TCM series has been released for Windows, Xbox and PlayStation 2, the FIFAM series is only available for Windows.

The AZ series uses an aluminium engine block with cast iron cylinder liners and aluminium DOHC cylinder heads. The engine series features many advanced technologies including slant-squish combustion chambers,offset cylinder and crank centers, and the VVT-i continuously variable intake valve timing system. The aluminium engine measures 626 mm (25-in) long, 608 mm (24-in) wide, and 681 mm (27-in) tall. The cylinder block is an open-deck, midi-skirt die-cast aluminium type with cast-in iron liners and a die-cast aluminium lower crankcase and a stamped oil pan. The forged steel crankshaft is fully balanced with eight counterweights and supported by five main bearings. A helical gear pressed in No. 3 counterweight drives twin contra-rotating balance shafts in the shaft housing within the lower crankcase. The dual overhead camshafts are driven by a single-stage roller chain of 8.0 mm (0.3-in) pitch, enabling a narrow included valve angle of 27.5\\u00b0. The camshafts act on four valves per cylinder via bucket tappets. As in the recent Toyota engine practice, no clearance adjusting shim is employed. Valve diameters are 34.0 mm (1.3 in) for intake and 29.5 mm (1.2 in) for exhaust, with 8.0 mm (0.3-in) lift for both intake and exhaust. The four-vane VVT-i device is fitted on the intake camshaft, altering timing by 50\\u00b0. The valve cover is made of magnesium to save weight. Fuel is injected sequentially via an ultra-fine-atomization injector with twelve small injection holes, each 0.18 mm (0.01 in) in diameter. As in the smaller NZ engine, the new AZ adopts a plastic, built-up, and vibration-welded intake manifold integrating a large volume plenum chamber (3.5 L (214 in3) volume including a 1.3 L (79 in3) resonator). Exhaust manifolds are of tubular construction with integrated catalytic converters. The AZ is the replacement for the S engine.

During the engine's first decade of production, when overhead-valve engines were rare, it was usually known simply as the Ford V\\u20118, and the first car model in which it was installed, the Model 18, was (and still is) often called simply the \\\\\\\"Ford V\\u20118\\\\\\\", after its new engine. Although the V8 configuration was not new when the Ford V8 was introduced in 1932, the latter was a market first in the respect that it made an 8-cylinder affordable and a V engine affordable to the emerging mass market consumer for the first time. It was the first independently designed and built V8 engine produced by Ford for mass production, and it ranks as one of the company's most important developments. A fascination with ever-more-powerful engines was perhaps the most salient aspect of the American car and truck market for a half century, from 1923 until 1973. The Ford flathead V8 was perfectly in tune with the cultural moment of its introduction, leading the way into a future of which the Ford company was a principal architect. Thus it became a phenomenal success. The engine design, with various changes but no major ones, was installed in Ford passenger cars and trucks until 1953, making the engine's 21-year production run for the U.S. consumer market longer than the 19-year run of the Ford Model T engine for that market.

Engines were built in the Dearborn Engine Plant for the North American market, and in Ford's then-new engine plant in Bridgend in Wales for the European market. The engine was originally conceived in 1974 and had a single overhead cam. Its valves were mounted at a compound angle in hemispherical combustion chambers, although some versions altered the combustion chamber shape to increase swirl. It also featured hydraulic valve lifters, a first for a European Ford engine. The engine was given different names throughout its production. From 1991 to 1996 in the Ford Escort, it was \\\\\\\"1.9L SEFI\\\\\\\"; and from 1997 to 2002, it was \\\\\\\"Split Port Induction 2000\\\\\\\".

Despite its considerable shortcomings in terms of Noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) and its intolerance of poor or neglected servicing, the CVH was regarded as being a very easy engine to tune, with many of its key components being considerably over-engineered. It wasn't long before the engine started receiving attention from the aftermarket tuning industry, and the 1.6 L version quickly became a stalwart of the tuning scene in the 1980s and 1990s with some significant increases in power output (over 200 bhp (150 kW)) being extracted from the turbocharged variants. The naturally aspirated 1.6 L was a popular choice for the kit car industry, where it could be relatively easily and cheaply tweaked to around 130 bhp (97 kW).

Iowa was won by Democratic Governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts with 54.71% of the popular vote over Republican Vice President George H.W. Bush's 44.50%, a victory margin of 10.22%. This made it one of 10 states (plus the District of Columbia) to vote for Dukakis, while Bush won a convincing electoral victory nationwide. The farm crisis of the 1980s under the incumbent Republican administration made the Midwest one of the targets for the Dukakis campaign in 1988, which ultimately proved successful in the region with Democrats performing strongly in many farm states. Nowhere was this more evident than in Iowa, which was the second most Democratic state in the nation in 1988 in terms of both vote percentage and victory margin; it was one of just two states (along with Rhode Island) to vote Democratic by a double digit margin. This Democratic support was spread widely across the state, with Dukakis winning 75 of the state's 99 counties. Iowa was also the only state in the nation which Dukakis won by a larger margin than fellow Democrat Bill Clinton would win it by four years later in 1992; Dukakis won 13 counties in Iowa in 1988 which would vote for Bush in 1992. While Dukakis personally overperformed in Iowa due to the farm crisis, 1988 was also the beginning of a long-term re-alignment of the state toward the Democratic Party, as the historically-Republican state has been a Democratic-leaning state ever since; prior to this election, Iowa had voted Republican in the five preceding elections.

From Minden, the highway branched east to Haliburton Village and thereafter followed the present route of Highway 118 to Highway 28 in Paudash. Highway 121 was established in 1955, connecting to Highway 35 near Fenelon Falls and Minden.

It is reached by Autoroute 640 at exit 44. The runway is parallel to Autoroute 640. A radio equipped aircraft is required to fly in and out of Mascouche Airport. The mandatory frequency for the airport is 122.35 MHz. The Mascouche airport is the largest \\\\\\\"regional airport\\\\\\\" in the province of Quebec, in terms of air traffic. It is located close to the Le Gardeur regional hospital and could be used for medical evacuations in the future. The airport regroups 30 buildings, 15 related SMEs (including Cargair Inc., ALM Par Avion, and others) and sustains 75 full-time jobs. More than a hundred small planes are stationed there year-round. There has been talks of closing down (or to privatize) the airport during the last decade, for various reasons: the land lots are well-located and are zoned industrial, the city is unwilling to invest in the airport, and the airport couldn't get funds from the government to build a control tower and to expand the runway's length. Moreover, the poor condition of the airport (i.e. its runway and its buildings) would need considerable investments in a close future. To counter the closure of the airport, users have founded a group (Mascouche Airport Owners and Pilots Association MAOPA). With more than 125 members, this dynamic group fights hard to keep the airport open, organizing many activities to stimulate the interest of the population about the airport. Mascouche airport is home to several flying schools. Therefore, it is an important learning centre for new pilots. Indeed, the airport offers a great alternative to Montr\\u00e9al\\u2013Pierre-Elliot Trudeau International Airport (which charges important landing fees).

The planned project includes a new subway station, track connections and a common downtown airport check-in facility for train service to both O'Hare and Midway airports. Since the purchase in April 2007 the project has stalled. The CTA has pulled out of the project and the current economic climate has stalled the project. Delays in completion have caused the project to lose major tenants. Both Block 37 and The Mills Corporation have histories of financial difficulties. Block 37 had been demolished in 1989 for a hotly contested redevelopment plan under the then new Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. The debates included the demolition of the Chicago Landmark McCarthy Building, which proceeded after the Illinois Supreme Court decided private preservation groups did not have standing to challenge the city's decision. Once the site was cleared, the initial redevelopment plan fell through, as did several subsequent plans, leaving the block vacant and undeveloped for nearly a generation. The Mills Corporation has itself been in financial difficulty in the past. This reputation and changing financial climate caused a delay in 2006 as contractors feared not getting paid. During the construction, cost overruns and delays have forced the city of Chicago and the Chicago Transit Authority to make up for a shortfall of over $100 million. In November 2009, the developer was declared in default and CB Richard Ellis was named receiver. By February 2012, the building remained only 26 percent occupied due to the undesirability of leasing space in bankruptcy proceedings. Construction of the apartment tower began in October 2014. The retail spaces remained only 52 percent leased at the time.\", \"trunc_text\": \"108 North State Street is a site currently under development as an urban center located in the Loop community area of do\", \"r\": 0, \"color\": \"none\"}, {\"x1\": 2.1324503421783447, \"x2\": 4.565775394439697, \"text\": \"Argyle International Airport is a yet-to-be completed government project that has been under construction in St. Vincent and the Grenadines for seven and a half years.

The 1971 season was part of a 35-game winning streak that consisted of three consecutive seasons from 1969 through 1971. During the streak, Toledo won three consecutive MAC championships and three consecutive bowl games, led the nation in total defense all three years, and outscored opponents by a combined total of 1,152 to 344. It remains the second longest winning streak in modern Division I-A college football history behind Oklahoma's 47-game streak in the 1950s. The defense led the way for the 1971 team, allowing only 164.6 total yards per game, a figure which remains a school record. Quarterback Chuck Ealey, who had led Toledo to all three undefeated seasons, finished eighth in the 1971 Heisman Trophy voting with 168 points. Ealey was also selected as a first-team All-American by the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) and Football News. For the third consecutive year, Ealey was also named the MAC Back of the Year. For the second consecutive year, he received the Jim Nicholson Award as the player contributing the most to the team's success. Defensive tackle Mel Long was a consensus All-American, receiving first-team honors from the Associated Press, FWAA, Newspaper Enterprise Association, and United Press International. Long was the first consensus All-American in MAC history. Long was also named MAC Lineman of the Year for the second consecutive year. Five Toledo players received first-team All-MAC honors: Chuck Ealey, Mel Long, tailback Joe Schwartz, end Don Fair, tight end Al Baker, defensive end Bob Rose, linebacker John Niezgoda, and defensive backs Gary Hinkson and John Saunders.

Bands such as Venom, Celtic Frost, Slayer, and Kreator were important influences on the genre's creation. Possessed and Death, along with bands such as Obituary, Autopsy and Morbid Angel, are often considered pioneers of the genre.

The games were developed by the German studio Bright Future GmbH and EA Sports. The game was called Total Club Manager (short: TCM) until the name changed to FIFA Manager with the FIFAM 06. It was announced FIFA Manager's last installment was FIFA Manager 14 and that there would be no further editions to the game. Before FIFAM and TCM, EA Sports released FIFA Soccer Manager (1997) and The FA Premier League Football Manager 99, 2000, 2001 and 2002, but while the first managed to attract some attention, the latter were released when the managing games market for non-Championship Manager titles was close to non-existent, and after two unsuccessful titles, it was dropped. However, by 2001, several employees of German software house Ascaron, who developed the highly popular Anstoss series in the past moved to EA, and the first game, Fussball Manager 2002, was released in Germany only, as a test for a potential series. It resembled Anstoss 3, although on a more serious note (in Anstoss, players could be abducted by aliens, train in Area 51 or use performance-enhancing drugs) and fewer financial options (managers developed by German teams often include deep financial options, such as stock and real estate markets). The game had positive reception, and a year later Total Club Manager 2003 was released, with Bobby Robson on the cover (for the second time, after FIFA Soccer Manager). One of the key features of Anstoss 3 was the ability to actually play the games after Anstoss Action was released. Although it could be played as a stand-alone game, it only reached the full potential when used with the manager game. This feature, only present on other games with limited geographical distribution, the Spanish PC F\\u00fatbol, was included for buyers of both TCM 2004 and FIFA 2004, which could use the Football Fusion function. Some fans managed to control games in TCM 2003 by hacking the configuration files, but data loss and corruption was frequent. Celtic manager Martin O'Neill appeared on the cover of TCM 2004. Criticized by a confusing interface, EA reworked it for TCM 2005, with a more sleek design. European Champion with former FC Porto and Chelsea manager Jos\\u00e9 Mourinho was selected for the main cover. While the TCM series has been released for Windows, Xbox and PlayStation 2, the FIFAM series is only available for Windows. The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions of the game were developed for EA Canada by Budcat Creations.\", \"trunc_text\": \"FIFA Manager (short: FIFAM) was an association football series of sport management games published by Electronic Arts.
